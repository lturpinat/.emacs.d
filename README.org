* Design choices

I formerly choosed to use org files to gather my configuration settings in one file. As it brought
nice form to the whole configuration, it felt more and more harder to debug it, while adding adding some delay on initialisation.
As a consequence, I decided to break it apart, and start anew with the old-fashioned way : splitting everything into folders and files. It does feel a little bit heavier, but it is truly efficient when it comes to loading and debugging (especially that one).

* Hierarchy

Here is the hierarchy of the folders as of 23/10

** init.el

The *init.el* basically only loads the other configuration files. I could have used a convenient function to load it all at once, but I preferred to put one load by file - at least for now. It enables me to quickly choose which "extra-feature" I want on and enhances debugging neatly.

** BasicSettings.el

This file contains global settings that I want to apply on all my Emacs configuration. It tends not to rely on some technologies or plugins (except their name so that the package manager download them).

** GlobalShortcuts.el

Follows the same philosophy than *BasicSettings.el* but with shortcuts.

** languages

Contains files that have great impact on a specific language.

** plugins

Each plugin requiring configuration is inside that folder - it also contains its specific bindings.

** scripts

Contains cumbersome scripts that improve my use of Emacs.
